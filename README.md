LabPilot is a lightweight and fully responsive web application designed to simplify laboratory operations in schools and universities. The goal of this project is to give students and staff a single place to manage practical sessions, equipment, chemicals, attendance, and report submissions without relying on manual paperwork or scattered systems.

𝙊𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙫𝙞𝙚𝙬 :

Laboratories often face issues like missing equipment records, unclear practical instructions, difficulty marking attendance, and no proper method for sharing reports or updates. LabPilot was created to solve these problems by providing a clean, modern interface powered by React on the frontend and Firebase for authentication, database, and storage.
The system is mobile-friendly, easy to use, and adaptable for different laboratory environments such as chemistry, physics, biology, or IT labs.
